# Development

This project is setup of an API so that it will store IoT devices that can be used within our space. I only implemented IoT devices that can be seen in a modern home, but the extention that IoT devices can have within schools, universities and offices is far larger. Stakeholders can use this project to check what IoT devices people are using and where. This will help to develop a market and to show people that IoT devices is the "future" and will make tedious like forgeting the lights on, a simpler task.

Users can use the API to list when and where they use IoT devices in their day-to-day life. This will ensure that the databse get populated and will help the stakeholders get a better idea of what people are using and in what matter.

# Extra info

I added an .gitignore file that hide everything for the program itself. I hid the .json files (appsetting.json -Has my password within the code, aswell as my connection string) and .cs files (Contains all of my data within the database, as some of the cs code contains passwords and sensitive data). (Scraped idea as there is no code to review)

I added an new .gitignore from the internet that contains all of the files that can be traced and store passwords or sensitive data

Updated my Scrum regarding project 2 (https://github.com/Heinrich-Swart/CMPG-323-Overview-34375309)

I am not sure if my authorize is working, as I do not know how to generate a token. I implemented the code for the authorize, but commented it out, so the databse can be tested without being authorized.
