# CMPG-323-Project-2-34375309

# Development

This project is setup of an API so that it will store IoT devices that can be used within our space. I only implemented IoT devices that can be seen in a modern home, but the extention that IoT devices can have within schools, universities and offices is far larger. Stakeholders can use this project to check what IoT devices people are using and where. This will help to develop a market and to show people that IoT devices is the "future" and will make tedious like forgeting the lights on, a simpler task.

# Extra info

I added an .gitignore file that hide everything for the program itself. I hid the .json files (appsetting.json -Has my password within the code, aswell as my connection string) and .cs files (Contains all of my data within the database, as some of the cs code contains passwords and sensitive data).
